Each system is deisgned to work independently of the others

Systems are designed to be exported as a package into other projects for quick adaptation

# Systems

## Room: 
This system is designed off of the 1993 Link's Awakening Game. It is deigned so that throughout the game are "Rooms" and each room contains objects that must stay within that room. The system is focused on the logic that happens to make room switching seamless without changing scenes

## Turn Battle:
This system is designed to allow for a list of "players" to be in a list for a battle. Their order is deiceded based on an equation. This system also includes basic UI used in the debugging.

## Active Battle: (WIP)
This system is designed to imitate the Ability System of Final Fantasy XIV where a user has a hotbar of actions that perform actions

## Weapon: (WIP)
This is a 2D weapon system designed for the developer to customize the size of a weapons coverage on a per weapon basis rather tahn per weapon type

## Class: (WIP)
This small system is about a player having multiple classes that contain different attributes and abilities
